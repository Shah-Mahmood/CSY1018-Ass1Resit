    Hello! My name is Shah Mahmood. I'm a Student, currently studying HND Computing: Web Technology and Security at the University of Northampton. For my project, I'm putting this site together and creating a portfolio about myself, consisting of four pages:
    index, bio, contact and cv. Outside of Studies I'm a keen photographer, member of the University Badminton team with some medals to my name from my secondary school years and an intermediate yoyo player with an aim of competing in the UK National
    Contest. So, welcome to my site and I hope you enjoy exploring the pages.
